# About

With 8+ years of experience in offensive security, I specialize in red teaming, reverse engineering, and Windows research. My work focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities to strengthen organizational defenses. I have also delivered live training sessions to help others build their skills in offensive security.

Currently, I serve as a Senior Red Team / Offensive Security Engineer for the Dubai Government, where I lead high-stakes security assessments and contribute to enhancing the organization’s cybersecurity posture.
